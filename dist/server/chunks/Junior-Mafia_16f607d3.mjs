He is a beatmaker and producer who has learnt his craft by studying producers and artists within the camp. In 2018, aged 14, Junior created his very first beat and since then has built his own makeshift studio in the camp. “Now that I have a studio, I even offer recording for up and coming artists in and outside the camp,” says Junior. By sharing his passion, Junior plans to become one of the biggest producers in Malawi. \n\n\n";
