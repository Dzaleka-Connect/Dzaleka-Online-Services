### Story Behind the Shot

"Now, we don't even get to that." Due to budgetary constraints, the newcomers have practically nothing to raise a roof with and UNHCR, which manages the compound together with the Malawian government, has trouble even providing them with plastic tarps. “Donors have been helping here for many years. And there are other crises [even in Malawi itself, through whose southern border thousands of Mozambicans flee from violence] which makes it not so easy right now to sell Dzaleka to the world again, ”says Kelvin S. Sentala, assistant to Unhcr field. CARLOS MARTINEZ
