## About This Photo

A young man works on the construction of a shelter in Dzaleka. Working is not only a necessity to obtain means to earn a living, but also a way to regain self-esteem and self-confidence. For this reason, and to limit dependence on the increasingly scarce aid, the agencies present in the camp yearn for a relaxation of the Malawian law that allows refugees to work in the country. Although there was a promising moment, for now the legal change is stagnant. The Government has decided to merge the reform of this regulation and that of immigration policies (such as the reception and transit of migrants bound for South Africa) and other issues into a single process, leaving it bogged down in Parliament for now.
