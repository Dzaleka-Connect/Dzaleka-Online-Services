## About This Photo

Just a 45-minute drive from the center of Lilongwe is Dzaleka Refugee Camp, a home for thousands of refugees for the past 20 years. This past Saturday, that Tumaini Festival was held to raise awareness for the camp and educate people about the continuing struggles of the refugees. We heard music from both Malawian artists and those from the camp and got to walk around the shops and houses. It was a powerful experience, especially with the camp being located so close to my home-away-from-home in Lilongwe. Perhaps the most meaningful part of the experience was talking to the director of the center for children with disabilities. After working with children with disabilities in both the United States and Peru, it was very special to see these facilities.
