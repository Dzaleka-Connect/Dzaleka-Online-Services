## About This Photo

Andy was only 16 when he arrived in Malawi after escaping an armed group where he was recruited as a child soldier. Fortunately, he was reunited with his mother three months later in Dzaleka and together they began their new life. He enrolled in vocational skills training, where he learned how to code. “I created my own messaging app. Initially, it was only for my girlfriend and I, but I hope it will take off one day,” says Andy.
