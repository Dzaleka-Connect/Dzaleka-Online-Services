Serge Kasongo is a distinguished visual artist and art educator from the Democratic Republic of Congo, now based in Lilongwe, Malawi. His journey in art began in his hometown of Kalemie, DRC, and was further developed through formal education at the prestigious Academie des Beaux Arts in Kinshasa, where he obtained his degree in painting in 2013.

As the Team Leader for Visual Arts and Crafts, Serge has demonstrated exceptional talent not only in creating art but also in nurturing new artists. His teaching experience began at Dzaleka Refugee Camp, where he volunteered at the Salama Africa Creative Centre, teaching youth the fundamentals of drawing and painting. His dedication to art education has helped many young refugees discover and develop their artistic talents.

Serge's artwork commands respect in the local art market, with pieces selling from 30,000 to 250,000 Malawian Kwacha. His work has been featured in various exhibitions across Malawian cities, and he has been a regular participant in the renowned Tumaini Festival. His artistic style combines traditional African influences with contemporary techniques, creating unique pieces that tell powerful stories of resilience and hope.

Currently residing in Lilongwe with special government authorization, Serge continues to create art and teach while working towards his dream of opening his own gallery. This gallery would not only showcase his work but also provide a platform for other refugee artists to display their talents to the world.

For art lessons or commissions, Serge can be contacted via WhatsApp at +265-996-87-9942. He offers both individual and group classes, and his teaching methodology is suitable for all skill levels, from complete beginners to advanced artists.
