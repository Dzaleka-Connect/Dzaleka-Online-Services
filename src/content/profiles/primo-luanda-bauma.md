# About Me
Primo Luanda Bauma is from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Born in Goma in the North Kivu province, Primo came to Malawi with his family in 2016, fleeing insecurity and violence. Arriving in the Dzaleka refugee camp with his family, he was lost. He felt that his life had no meaning, as he had few prospects and life in the camp was difficult. Forced to flee to a country he'd never been to, with just his family, and no friends or connections to rely on, Primo felt stuck. Soon after arriving in the camp, Primo struggled and did not know how to get out of the hole he found himself in. But he was able to find a new sense of purpose and meaning through his artwork and his photography. Taking a photography course with an organization in Dzaleka that offered it, Primo started to pursue photography not merely as art, but as life as well.

Primo started volunteering with organizations in the Dzaleka camp, and encouraged his family to pursue education, as he believes its value cannot be overstated. Seeking to set an example for his family, he pursued photography and now is one of the most recognized photographers in the camp. He has enjoyed success, such as having an exhibition in Malawi's capital Lilongwe. Primo now is extended invitations to festivals, exhibitions, and more. He is also currently working with a carpenter to produce custom-made frames so that he can frame his photographs for exhibits and for sale.
