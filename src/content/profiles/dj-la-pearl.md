  As a professional DJ, I specialize in:

  Services offered:
  - Club performances

  Background:
  Originally from DRC, I discovered my passion for DJing after arriving in Dzaleka 10 years ago. Despite initial community resistance to female DJs, I persevered and turned my love for music into a successful career. Starting from club performances within the camp, I've now expanded to venues outside, proving that passion knows no boundaries.
