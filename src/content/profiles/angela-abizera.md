Angela Abizera is a talented poet and community leader from Rwanda, currently residing in Dzaleka Refugee Camp, Malawi. As the Team Leader for Poetry at Dzaleka Arts Project, she combines her love for creative writing with her dedication to community service.

Her journey into poetry began naturally, writing short fiction stories and dramas before focusing on poetry. Her work gained recognition when members of the Branches Arts Group discovered her talent through her powerful poem "Dear Peace." Despite having no formal training in poetry, Angela's natural ability to convey deep emotions and important messages through her verses has made her a respected voice in the community.

Here are two of her notable poems:

**Dear Peace**
```
I heard you are capable
But we don't live in humble
I heard you are responsible
But we are unable

Wars don't cease
We are not living at ease
For they still tease
We are not going to please

We are forced to flee
Called a refugee
But we hope to be free
Like pollen we wait for our bee
```

**Love Found Us Young**
```
I saw him
Him that caught my eyes
Wide and eager
I had to see him

His presence caressed me
He spoke softly
As I looked into his eyes
There was something deep

Love found us
Young
```

Beyond her artistic pursuits, Angela is pursuing an online degree and works as a volunteer mentor for the Dzaleka Children Parliament under Plan International Malawi. She believes in using poetry as a powerful tool for both entertainment and education, addressing important social issues while also celebrating the beauty of human emotions like love.

Angela sees art as a medium for positive change, using her poetry to "paint the world" and sensitize people to various social issues. Her work often touches on themes of peace, refugee experiences, love, and hope, making her voice an important part of the camp's artistic community.
