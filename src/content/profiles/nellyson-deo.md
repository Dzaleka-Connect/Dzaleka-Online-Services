Nellyson Deo is a talented dancer and choreographer who serves as the Team Leader for Dance at the Dzaleka Arts Project. Born in Kivu Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nellyson's journey in dance began after arriving at Dzaleka Refugee Camp in 2012, where he discovered dance as a form of therapy and self-expression.

His dance career started with the Salama Africa organization, where his natural talent caught the attention of founder Toussaint Farini Buunda. In 2015, Nellyson joined the Forus Crew, a name that stands for "force," "unity," and "success." Through dedication and countless hours of practice, he has developed into one of the camp's most accomplished dancers.

Nellyson's performances have reached impressive heights, including collaborations with Malawi's leading artists such as Tay Grin, Gwamba, Sangie, and Hazel Mak. A career highlight was performing alongside American DJ Major Laser in 2018. His crew is a regular feature at the annual Tumaini Festival, where they showcase their talents to an international audience.

As a choreographer, Nellyson draws inspiration from everyday life in Dzaleka, transforming ordinary moments - from children playing to adults dancing in the streets - into creative dance routines. His ability to find artistic inspiration in his surroundings has helped him develop unique choreographies that blend various dance styles.

A 2022 high school graduate, Nellyson balances his artistic pursuits with academic ambitions, having applied to several universities. While awaiting potential resettlement to the United States through UNHCR, he continues to develop his craft and inspire others through dance, despite the challenges of refugee status restrictions.

For bookings or dance lessons, Nellyson can be contacted via WhatsApp at +265-99-704-6461. He offers both individual and group dance instruction, welcoming students of all skill levels who wish to explore the transformative power of dance.
