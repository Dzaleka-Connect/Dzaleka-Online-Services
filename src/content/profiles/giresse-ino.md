Giresse Ino is a talented musician and the Team Leader for Music at Dzaleka Arts Project. Born on May 5, 1988, in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Giresse carries forward a rich musical heritage from his family, where both his father's side and his mother were singers.

Music has been a constant thread throughout Giresse's life, beginning in his early years when he started singing in church and school. His musical style focuses on gospel music, incorporating traditional Congolese rumba and seben styles, creating a unique fusion of spiritual and cultural elements.

In 2017, Giresse and his wife Lydia Kabwe arrived at Dzaleka Refugee Camp, where they have since built a new life. Despite the challenges of displacement, Giresse has continued to pursue his musical passion, using his talent to inspire and uplift others in the camp community. His wife, who speaks French, Lingala, and Swahili, has been a supportive partner in his musical journey.

Currently residing in Dzaleka with his wife and two children (a baby girl and a two-year-old son), Giresse continues to develop his musical career while facing the limitations of camp life. His story is one of resilience and determination, using music as a means of expression and healing.

As a musician in Dzaleka, Giresse recognizes the challenges of pursuing an artistic career in a refugee setting. He seeks support and opportunities to further develop his talent and share his music with a broader audience, believing that music can bridge cultural divides and bring hope to those in difficult circumstances.
