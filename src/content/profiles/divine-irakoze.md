Divine Irakoze is a dedicated refugee rights advocate and writer from Burundi, currently pursuing International Relations at Brigham Young University, Idaho. Born in a refugee camp in Tanzania and having spent most of her life in Dzaleka Refugee Camp, Divine brings a unique and powerful perspective to refugee advocacy, particularly focusing on the rights of women and young people.

Her journey began when her parents fled Burundi in 1994 for Tanzania, and later moved to Malawi in 2004. Through her experiences, Divine has developed a deep understanding of refugee life that goes beyond national origins or reasons for displacement. Her advocacy work is driven by a vision of refugees living normal lives in their host countries, with equal opportunities in education, employment, and social integration.

As a graduate of the Young African Leader Initiative, Divine has been actively involved in various community projects. She has established a youth project supporting vulnerable community members in Dzaleka and continues to advocate for refugee rights through her writing. Her articles, published on platforms like Missing Perspectives and DzalekaConnect, shed light on life in refugee camps and propose solutions for improving refugees' lives.

In 2022, Divine made the difficult decision to accept an opportunity to study at BYU-Idaho, leaving behind her family of eleven siblings and numerous community projects. This move, while challenging, has strengthened her resolve to advocate for refugees on a global scale. Her current studies in International Relations are helping her understand the interconnected nature of global systems and their impact on refugee populations worldwide.

Divine is currently working on a new article exploring how refugees are represented in different countries, aiming to challenge existing perspectives and promote more humane treatment of refugee populations. Her experience transitioning from life in Dzaleka to the United States has given her unique insights into the stark contrasts between refugee life and the freedoms of unrestricted movement and opportunity.

Through her writing and advocacy, Divine continues to be a voice for those still living in refugee camps, working towards a future where refugee status doesn't limit one's potential or opportunities in life.
