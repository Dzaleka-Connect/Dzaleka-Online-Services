description: "Language exchange program connecting participants from the Midwest with Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi."
---

LEP is organized to facilitate relationships through learning. Participants are based in the Midwest and Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi, and each takes on both the role of teacher and student, as they share their language while learning the other. Over video calls and messaging on WhatsApp, participants will provide lessons on how to speak English or Swahili, and they will then learn how to speak the language they do not know. To make this a reality, participants will create lesson plans and content to be shared with their language partners, and partners will share and learn from each other's content once a week. Through their involvement in the program, participants will gain meaningful experiences teaching English or Swahili as a second language, while learning a new language and culture.
