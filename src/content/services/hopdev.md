## About Hope of refugee women against poverty for the social wellbeing(HOPDEV)

Hope of Refugee Women against Poverty for Social Wellbeing (HOPDEV) is a grassroots, women-led, and feminist organization founded in 2014 by a group of women and girls who are survivors of civil wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, and Ethiopia.

Our mission is to empower the most disadvantaged women, girls, and youth, particularly those from diverse backgroundsâ€”including women and girls with disabilities, HIV/AIDS, or those with no income, we help these individuals overcome poverty, claim their rights, and challenge discrimination by providing essential skills, resources, and education. We focus on improving mental health, well-being, self-confidence, and decision-making, which ultimately benefits their families and communities.

Our work also addresses key issues that directly contribute to ending Zero Hunger and advancing economic independence, education, and climate resilience. By empowering women and girls, especially those living in conflict-affected and vulnerable environments, we help them build resilience against gender-based violence, food insecurity, and the impacts of climate change.
