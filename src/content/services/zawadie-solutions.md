## About Zawadie Solutions

Business outsourcing and refugee employment services.

### Local Partnerships
We partner with local NGOs which allows us to connect with the local community and ensure the refugees receive the support they need to succeed. We rent out space so it helps supports the life changing works of NGOS

### Our History
Tyler Clark’s visit to Malawi in January 2024 was a significant milestone for Zawadie Solutions. This picture was taken to commemorate this meeting, symbolizing the collaboration and shared commitment between Tyler and the Zawadie team in Malawi. It was intended to be featured on our website to showcase our international partnerships, highlight the progress we’ve made, and inspire confidence in our mission to provide outsourcing solutions to companies in the world.
