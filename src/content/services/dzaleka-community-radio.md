## About Dzaleka Community Radio

Dzaleka Community Radio, known as Yetu Radio, is a community-run station based in Dzaleka Refugee Camp, Malawi. Established in 2018 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), its mission is to foster peaceful coexistence between Malawian and refugee communities by addressing issues such as child protection, gender-based violence, and human rights. 

Broadcasting on 99.1 MHz FM, Yetu Radio is unique in Malawi for its multilingual programming, offering content in English, Chichewa, Kiswahili, French, and Kinyarwanda.  This diversity ensures accessibility to a wide audience within the camp and surrounding areas.

The station provides a platform for refugees and host community members to share their stories, discuss pertinent issues, and access vital information. By promoting cultural exchange and community engagement, Yetu Radio plays a pivotal role in empowering individuals and fostering a sense of unity among diverse populations.
