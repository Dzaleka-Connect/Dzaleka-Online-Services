## About Tumaini Letu

Tumaini Letu (“Our Hope”) is a non-profit organization based within the Dzaleka Refugee Camp in Malawi. The organisation was founded in 2012 by Trésor Nzengu Mpauni (widely known as Menes la Plume) – a refugee from the DRC. Tumaini Letu exists to promote economic, social and cultural inclusion of refugees in Malawi by building capacity of refugees through workshops and training as well as creating business and connection opportunities for refugees by opening the doors of Dzaleka to visitors from around the world.

Tumaini Letu’s work is founded, designed and run by and for refugees together with members of the host country. Annually, Tumaini Letu creates business and job opportunities for 1,500 refugees and facilitates workshops to 400 refugee women in entrepreneurship skills. 400 refugee families (2000 individuals) per year benefit from hospitality training and generate income hosting guests in their houses through the Dzaleka Homestay Program which is a Home-based Tourism initiative by Tumaini Letu. Tumaini Letu’s programs provide an opportunity for cultural exchange and raise awareness by highlighting the challenges refugees are facing, as well as refugee resilience and strength.
