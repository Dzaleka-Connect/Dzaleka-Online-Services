## About Fraternity Without Borders

In sub-Saharan Africa, we open and maintain reception centers, where we offer food, hygiene care, pedagogical, cultural activities, and vocational training. We’ve been able to help with the food and house building. We are drilling from artesian wells in African villages, and, with the arrival of water, we have started sustainable food cultivation, empowering young farmers, and involving children in environmental education activities.

In Brazil, we support the treatment of children with microcephaly, in Campina Grande, Paraíba, in partnership with the Research Institute Professor Joaquim Amorim Neto. In Campo Grande, we maintain the Emmanuel Young Philharmonic Orchestra project, which provides music teaching to young people from the periphery, and helped the Clinic of the Soul, dedicated to the treatment of chemical addicts. In Roraima, we welcome refugee families from Venezuela, who crossed the border into Brazil in search of a chance.

### Mission

To experience and encourage the practice of fraternity, without ethnical, geographical or religious constraint, sheltering primarily children and adolescents in situation of vulnerability or social risk.
