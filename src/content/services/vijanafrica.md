## About VijanAfrica

Vijana Africa's Economic Empowerment programs are designed to help communities impacted by conflict and displacement achieve economic sustainability and reduce reliance on conflict minerals.

Vijana Africa's education initiatives aim at empowering youth and young adults through capacity building, skills building, and literacy in DRC, Malawi and USA

In Eastern DRC, we are implementing a Mobile School for war displaced kids who would otherwise have no access to education. They learn computer basics, reading, writing, and basic mathematics to prepare them for a better future.
