## About EcoYouth

EcoYouth, a non-profit community-based organization in Dzaleka Refugee Camp, was founded by George Matali and Raymond Makutubu with a mission to address environmental pollution in the camp. Dzaleka Refugee Camp, home to approximately 60,000 people, grapples with dire living conditions exacerbated by factors like congestion, inadequate plastic waste management, poor air quality, and a lack of concern for water, sanitation, and hygiene. George and Raymond, recognizing these challenges, established EcoYouth as a youth-led organization. Their aim is to unite the community, fostering awareness, and implementing grassroots-level programs to combat sustainability issues. In the pursuit of their vision for a clean and sustainable environment, EcoYouth outlines specific goals. By the year 2026, they aspire to reduce plastic waste in Dzaleka Refugee Camp by 80%, plant 300 trees, raise awareness on waste management and hygiene issues, educate on sustainable farming, and create income-generating activities through recycled materials in arts. EcoYouth strategically organizes various activities aligned with their goals. These include awareness campaigns on the long-term impacts of plastic waste, monitoring and recycling plastic waste, social service days within and beyond the Refugee Camp, disseminating knowledge through radio on crosscutting issues, vocational training programs in agriculture, afforestation and reafforestation activities, training youth to utilize waste for artistic materials, and even painting trees. This multifaceted approach ensures that EcoYouth not only addresses immediate environmental concerns but also works towards long-term sustainability and community empowerment. The interconnected activities synergize to create a comprehensive strategy for positive change in Dzaleka Refugee Camp.
