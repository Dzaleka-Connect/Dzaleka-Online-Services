## About Kibebe Malawi 

**Kibébé** is an African lifestyle brand based in Malawi, dedicated to economically empowering refugees and Malawians through the creation of handmade, sustainable, and eco-friendly products. Founded in 2013, Kibébé collaborates with skilled artisans, many of whom are refugees from the Dzaleka Refugee Camp, to transform colorful chitenje (traditional fabric) into a curated collection of handcrafted items. 

**Mission:** To economically empower refugees and Malawians by creating sustainable, eco-friendly products that showcase the rich cultural heritage of Malawi.

**Vision:** To be a leading African lifestyle brand that provides meaningful employment opportunities, promotes sustainability, and celebrates the artistry of Malawian artisans.

**Products:** Kibébé offers a diverse range of products, including home goods, baby and kids' items, bags, stationery, and gifts. Each product is handcrafted with love, bringing vibrant colors and happiness into daily life. 

**Impact:** By supporting Kibébé, customers contribute to the economic empowerment of artisans and the promotion of sustainable practices. The brand donates all its profits to "There is Hope," a Malawian non-profit providing vocational training and educational scholarships to people living in and around the Dzaleka Refugee Camp. 

**Online Presence:** Kibébé maintains an active online presence, showcasing its products and stories on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Through these channels, the brand engages with a global audience, sharing updates and connecting with supporters. 

**Location:** Kibébé operates in Lilongwe, Malawi, offering a charming gift shop experience where visitors can explore unique handcrafted treasures.
