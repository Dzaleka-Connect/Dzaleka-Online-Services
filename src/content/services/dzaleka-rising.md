## About Dzaleka Rising

Dzaleka Rising is community based organization, our aim is to create value for local products and services. Through this, we have various initiatives that contribute to our aim, among these initiative, we have a program by the name "Leader's Talk" the only TV program that happens in a refugee camp. Through Leader's Talk we invite leaders and stakeholders to educate and inspire the community through their personnel and professional experiences and achievements. We also do event hosting, as to promote activities that happen in the Dzaleka refugee camp. Through event hosting, we have successfully worked with Tumaini Letu organization in the media. We also target individual achievements from the Dzaleka refugee community to share their stories worldwide. We continue to create more programs that will create value for the local products and services.
