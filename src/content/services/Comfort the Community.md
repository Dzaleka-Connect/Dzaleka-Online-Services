## About Comfort the Community

Comfort the Community is a non-profit organization based in Dzaleka, dedicated to providing education and support for vulnerable children, including those with disabilities, Albinism, orphans, and other at-risk groups. The organization’s mission is to deliver quality education, promote community integration, and foster cross-cultural learning opportunities for these children.

The story of Comfort the Community began 13 years ago when Pascal Bagaluza, a skilled filmmaker, arrived at Dzaleka from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Initially, Pascal earned a living through his film-making work, but he soon realized the urgent need for educational resources in the camp. After nine years, he saw the severe shortage of schools and understood that something had to be done.

In response, Pascal rented a church building where refugee teachers began offering classes to the children. As the demand for education grew, he decided to expand the initiative. Comfort the Community was formally established with the vision to include both Malawian and refugee teachers and students in the program. A piece of land was purchased in Lilambwe village, located next to the refugee camp, and a simple school structure was constructed.

Today, Comfort the Community operates a school staffed equally by Malawian and refugee teachers, with leadership from Malawian education professionals. The school provides nursery, primary, and secondary education to over 570 children. The student body is diverse, with two-thirds of the students being Malawian and the remaining third being refugees. While most students attend at no cost, those who are able contribute 5,000 MK per month (about $6.15) to support the school’s operations.

Through its efforts, Comfort the Community has become a beacon of hope, providing not only education but also fostering a sense of unity and belonging for vulnerable children in the region.
