## About World Food Programme

The World Food Programme (WFP) is the world's largest humanitarian organization dedicated to combating hunger and promoting food security. Established in 1961, WFP operates in over 120 countries, providing life-saving assistance in emergencies and working to build pathways to peace, stability, and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters, and the impacts of climate change. 

**Mission:**
To save lives in emergencies and use food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability, and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters, and the impacts of climate change. 

**Vision:**
A world with zero hunger, where food assistance is no longer necessary, and all people have access to the food they need to lead healthy and active lives.

In 2020, WFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas, and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of food as a weapon of war and conflict.
