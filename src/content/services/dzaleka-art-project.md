## About Dzaleka Art Project

The Dzaleka Art Project is a community-based collaborative project by and about the arts and artists living as refugees in the Dzaleka camp in Malawi. Enjoy the talent and creativity in the camp while getting to know the dreams and struggles of some of its residents. Please consider visiting the website that complements the book and share what you learn with others.

The Dzaleka refugee camp in Malawi hosts more than 52,000 people from multiple countriesâ€”at present in April 2023, mostly from Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and some from Somalia. Though the conditions in the camp are tough, the camp is full of painters, dance-crews, musicians, poets, crafters, photographers, fashion designers, jewelry makers, dramatists, and digital artists.
