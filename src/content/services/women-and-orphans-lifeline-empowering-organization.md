## About Women and Orphans Lifeline Empowering Organization (WOLEO)

WOLEO is a non-profit organization launched and established on October 11, 2020, by PATRICK MAZIRANE in Malawi's Dowa District, specifically in the Dzaleka Refugees Camp. The Malawian government is dealing with numerous issues in the refugee camp for a variety of reasons. The primary issue is a shortage of necessities, which causes enormous hardship among the refugees. This unhappy life entices individuals to engage in extreme or immoral acts as a source of revenue, such as prostitution, robberies, and so on, and as a result, they have a detrimental impact on the Malawi government. The reason we created the mission, vision, and charity of demonstrate to the beneficiaries that they are not themselves in their life despite their failure to climb. We can still establish a new best today and in the future life for easier success if we improve, develop, and preserve the hope that has been lost in the past. The organization is here to elevate, empower, bring hope, and construct a new system that will allow them to rise above their previous hopelessness. We also intend to train them in other skills and talents, such as vocations and digital training, to help them. Our organization's Vision is to improve the lives of vulnerable or impoverished people, and our Mission is to reduce poverty by empowering vulnerable people.
