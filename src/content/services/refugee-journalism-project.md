## About Refugee Journalism Project

Since 2016, the Refugee Journalism Project has supported displaced and exiled journalists and media workers to continue their careers in the UK. These journalists have an impressive range of skills – many have been editors, correspondents, and producers in their own countries – but they face significant barriers when they attempt to continue their journalism in the UK.

Our core aims are to support the journalists to access opportunities in the UK’s media industry, whilst at the same time helping to shift negative narratives and public perceptions around migration.

We help the journalists to network and connect with the industry by updating their journalistic skills through workshops, and by identifying publishing opportunities, freelance work, and permanent roles. They also work with a mentor, who is an established journalist in the UK.

Our work has led to collaborations with global organisations including BAFTA, Bloomberg, the UNHCR, The Guardian Foundation, the Greater London Authority, and the Refugee Council.

Our participants have gone on to win media awards, get work published in the national media and gain paid work. There are currently ‘graduates’ work with at Bloomberg, Middle East Eye, The Washington Post, The Economist and the BBC.

The Refugee Journalism Project was founded by Vivienne Francis and is based at London College of Communication, part of the University of the Arts London.
