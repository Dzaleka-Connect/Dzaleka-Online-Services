**RELON-MALAWI** focuses on three key pillars:  
1. **Amplifying the Voices of Refugee-Led Organizations (RLOs):** We ensure RLOs have a platform to share their innovative solutions and ideas, empowering them to address community challenges sustainably.  
2. **Capacity Strengthening for RLOs:** We help RLOs improve project planning, management, and service quality, enhancing sustainability and donor confidence.  
3. **Providing Resources:** We offer sub-grants, grants, and training to help RLOs access funding, collaborate on projects, and build relationships with donors for continued support.

**Mission:**  
To amplify the voices of refugee-led organizations (RLOs), strengthen their capacities, and provide resources that enable them to address community challenges sustainably, improve service delivery, and secure financial support.

**Vision:**  
To empower refugee-led organizations to become influential, self-sustaining agents of change, driving impactful solutions for refugees and host communities through collaboration, capacity building, and resource access.
