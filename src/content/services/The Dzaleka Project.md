## About Dzaleka Project Society

The Dzaleka Project is a non-profit organization dedicated to changing the lives of refugees in Dzaleka refugee camp. Dzaleka, located in Malawi, South East Africa,  is a temporary home to refugees from Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Somalia. There are approximately 10,000 refugees residing at the camp, however the camp itself is only meant to accommodate 4,000 people. The refugees from Rwanda, Burundi, the DRC and Somalia at the Dzaleka refugee camp have identities that were shaped by their exposure to conflict and various abuses. Dzaleka camp is located in the Dowa district of Malawi, the coldest and windiest part of the country. Indeed, it used to be a prison for political prisoners.

## Our Story

Joselyne John established the Dzaleka Project in September 2008. When Joselyne was a refugee in Dzaleka refugee camp, her community involvement and strong  academic grades opened opportunities beyond her imagination. She received a World University Service of Canada scholarship to study at Simon Fraser University among hundreds of applicants in 2007. She is now working towards completing her bachelor’s degree in Health Sciences. Joseylne’s experience in various refugee camps and her desire to use her opportunities to make a difference in her refugee community and help her own family members inspired the Dzaleka Project to raise awareness about the situation of refugees in Dzaleka refugee camp and to commit to raising the $ 20,000 she needs to sponsor her family of 9 to come to Canada.

Since 2008 we continue to  grow as a charity, always welcoming new members. We have raised $4,700 of $ 30,000. As we work towards achieving our fund-raising goal and raising awareness about refugees, we welcome you to attend our events. With the help of  the Umoja Operation Compassion Society–a nonprofit organization based in Surrey which is helping  us to sponsor  this refugee family, we are able to provide tax deductible receipts for donations equal or more than $20.
