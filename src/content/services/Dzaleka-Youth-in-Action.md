## About Dzaleka Youth in Action

Dzaleka Youth in Action (DYIA) was established by Divine Irakoze, a 20-year-old refugee from Burundi living in Malawi's Dzaleka Refugee Camp. The organization's mission is to advocate for vulnerable children, youths, and elders within the camp. The inspiration for DYIA came when Divine encountered fellow refugees who had gone without food for over three days, prompting her to mobilize local youths to provide essential support. Despite challenges such as limited resources and financial constraints, DYIA remains committed to empowering the refugee community and plans to initiate income-generating activities to enhance their support efforts.
