ATE-Hub is a leading refugee-led non-profit organization dedicated to empowering refugees through education, employment, and advocacy. Founded by a group of dedicated individuals with lived experience as refugees, ATE-Hub understands the unique challenges and aspirations of this community.

### Mission

To empower refugees by providing them with the tools and opportunities they need to thrive. This includes:

- Flexible Learning Pathways: Offering accessible and culturally sensitive educational programs that build essential skills and bridge the gap to employment.
- Meaningful Employment Opportunities: Connecting refugees with employers who value their skills and experiences, fostering inclusive workplaces.
- Advocacy for Refugee Rights: Championing policies and practices that ensure the safety, dignity, and well-being of refugees at all levels.

### Approach

ATE-Hub operates with a deeply human-centered approach:

- Refugee-Led: Our staff and leadership are refugees themselves, bringing invaluable lived experience and cultural understanding to our work.
- Community-Driven: We actively engage with the refugee community to understand their needs and co-create solutions that truly address their challenges.
- Impact-Focused: We measure our success by the positive impact we have on the lives of refugees, empowering them to achieve their full potential.
