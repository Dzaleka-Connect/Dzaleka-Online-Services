## About Dzaleka Community Day Secondary School (CDSS)

Dzaleka Community Day Secondary School (CDSS) is situated within Malawi's Dzaleka Refugee Camp, which houses over 52,000 refugees from countries such as Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Rwanda. 

The school operates under the administration of Jesuit Refugee Services, providing educational opportunities to both refugee and local Malawian students. 

In October 2021, Dzaleka CDSS gained national recognition by winning the National Schools Science Fair held at Kamuzu Academy. Among the notable projects was a software developed by Justin Waka, a Form Three Congolese student, designed to reduce traffic accidents. Additionally, in January 2022, students from Dzaleka CDSS secured the top three positions in an essay competition organized by Unicaf University, further showcasing the school's academic excellence. 

The school has also been involved in cultural initiatives, contributing to the vibrant community life within the camp. For instance, the Salama Africa Dance Crew, based in Dzaleka Refugee Camp, has established itself as a prominent dance group in Malawi, performing at major festivals and collaborating with well-known artists. These achievements highlight Dzaleka CDSS's commitment to fostering both academic and artistic talents among its students.
