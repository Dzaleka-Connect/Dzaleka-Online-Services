## About Village Book Builders

Village Book Builders is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that connects communities to access to learning through quality books, computers, mentoring, and online education.

We believe everyone should have access to quality education. Since 2015, we have tirelessly promoted this mission with each library we build and programs we provide.

We create global communities of learners who gain access to a wide variety of learning methods including a monthly speaker series, online mentoring, and digital resources.

These programs and many other programs provide quality opportunities for connection and educational growth.
