## About Supportive Pillar Organisation

Supportive Pillar Organisation is a refugee-led organization dedicated to increasing refugee youth's accessibility to secondary education. We offer scholarships to young refugees living in extreme poverty and those who cannot support themselves. By sending them to schools outside of the refugee camps, we ensure they receive a quality education compared to what is available within the camps. Our primary focus is on students who need to return to school to improve their grades. Over 95% of students graduating from Dzaleka Community Day Secondary School graduate with grades too low to be selected by any universities. Additionally, we support those who never had the chance to start secondary school due to a lack of available spaces and those at risk of dropping out due to financial challenges. To date, we have supported more than 40 secondary students with school materials, fees, and mentorship programs. Our vision is to provide young people from impoverished backgrounds the opportunity to further their education and access opportunities that can transform their living conditions. We firmly believe that education can empower refugees and change their situations for the better.
