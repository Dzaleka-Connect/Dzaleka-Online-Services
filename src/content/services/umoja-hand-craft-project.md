## About UMOJA Hand Craft Project

Umoja Crafts is a refugee women’s craft-making group that works with recycled materials found in Dzaleka Refugee Camp, in Malawi.

Umoja means unity, or union in Swahili, the language spoken by many of the ladies. This is at the heart of everything that the group does. Initially comprised of only 12 women, the group was established in early 2010 and now includes 50 proud members. Skills and stories from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi and Rwanda come together to create the emotionally and professionally supportive environment that is Umoja Crafts.

>_We chose this name to represent how we feel as a community of women… taking time to sit, work and chat together, we have found ourselves building a new life through our crafts._

The group creates beautiful handmade and environmentally sustainable home decor items and accessories. Earnings are shared amongst the women and a percentage is maintained for administrative group costs and investments.
