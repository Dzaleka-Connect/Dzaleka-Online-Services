# How to Register a Company in Malawi

Starting a business in Malawi has become more streamlined with the introduction of the online registration system. This guide walks you through the process of registering your company using the Malawi Business Registration System (MBRS).

## Online Registration Process

Company registration in Malawi is now done entirely online through the MBRS portal. Here's how to get started:

### Step 1: Create an Account

1. Visit the official MBRS website: [https://mbrs.gov.mw](https://mbrs.gov.mw)
2. Click on "CREATE ACCOUNT"
3. Choose between "Citizen" (requires National ID) or "Non-Citizen" (requires Passport number)
4. Complete the registration form with your personal details

### Step 2: Prepare Required Documents

Before starting the registration process, make sure you have:
- A digital copy of your ID (National ID or Passport)
- Access to a printer
- Access to a scanner
- Company details including:
  - Proposed company name
  - Details of directors
  - Details of shareholders
  - Business activities

### Step 3: Company Incorporation

1. Log in to your MBRS account
2. Select "Company Incorporation" from the services menu
3. Fill in all required fields in the application form
4. The system will auto-generate the following documents as PDFs:
   - Consent and Certificate of Directors
   - Consent of Shareholders
   - Memorandum of Association
   - Articles of Association
5. Print these documents, sign them, and scan them
6. Upload the signed documents back to the system

### Step 4: Name Reservation

If you're not ready to register immediately, you can reserve your company name to prevent others from using it. Note that names containing "MALAWI" require approval from the Office of President and Cabinet.

### Step 5: Payment and Certification

1. After completing the application, you'll receive an Application Number
2. Take this number to FDH Bank at the registration office
3. Pay the registration fee of MK75,000 for a Limited Company
4. Once payment is processed, your status will change to "Registered"
5. Download your Certificate of Incorporation

The entire registration process typically takes about 36 hours to complete.
