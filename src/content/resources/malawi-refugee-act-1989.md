This landmark legislation from 1989 established the legal foundation for refugee protection and management in Malawi. The Act created key institutional structures and defined the framework that would later govern facilities like Dzaleka refugee camp.

Key provisions:
- Establishment of the Refugee Committee
- Definition of refugee status
- Rights and obligations of refugees
- Administrative structures
- Protection mechanisms

The Act remains a fundamental document in understanding Malawi's legal approach to refugee protection and management, providing the basis for current policies and practices.
