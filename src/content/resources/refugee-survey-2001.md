This 2001 survey documents a significant period in Dzaleka camp's history, when the refugee population nearly tripled due to influx from Congo-Kinshasa. The report details UNHCR's response and support services during this period of rapid growth.

Key highlights:
- Monthly arrival rates (150 refugees per month)
- UNHCR service provision (food, health services)
- Population growth statistics
- Aid distribution systems
- Camp management challenges

The report provides valuable historical context for understanding how Dzaleka camp adapted to handle significant population increases.
