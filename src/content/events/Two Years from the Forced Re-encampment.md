## Webinar Overview

On May 17, 2023, politically motivated propaganda escalated into devastating action, upending the lives of thousands of refugees in Malawi. Refugees living outside the designated camp were harassed, beaten, imprisoned, and stripped of their belongings as police, immigration officers, members of the group known as Small-scale Business Operators, and members of the ruling partyâ€™s youth wing carried out mass roundups.

This session reflects on the positive and negative impacts of forced re-encampment, explores the possibility of justice for victims, and asks: what comes next?
