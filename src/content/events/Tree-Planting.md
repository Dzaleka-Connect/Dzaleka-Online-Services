## Event Highlights

We invite you all to join us for our Tree planting event on February 7th, 2025 at Dzaleka refugee camp. However as we approach the day we continue to seek seedling donations to support this effort and transform Dzaleka Refugee Camp one seedling at a time, fostering a more sustainable environment.

We call on all well wishers to support our initiatives and help us grow a greener, brighter future for those rebuilding their lives.
