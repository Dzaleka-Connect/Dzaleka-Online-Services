## Zoom Meeting Overview

Refugees and migrants face misconceptions worldwide, but in this session, we focus on Malawi and the broader sub-Saharan Africa region. What are the most common myths, why do they persist, and how do these misconceptions shape perceptions and impact both refugees and host communities?

We will challenge these misunderstandings by presenting facts, sharing personal stories from refugees and migrants, and addressing the concerns of host communities.
