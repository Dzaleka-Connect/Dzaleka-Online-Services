On the 28th of August, the “Tumaini” team hosted the first Youth Conference – Tumaini Letu at Dzaleka.
The event was hosted specifically at the “There Is Hope” Technical and Vocational Training Centre, as was founded by Innocent Magambi – one of the panelists during the event.

The panel session started in the afternoon, with three guests: Innocent Magambi, Muriel Ilunga, Remy Gakwaya and Toussaint Farani.

The theme of the conference, and panel discussion was:

> “Engaging The Youth As Agents Of Social Cohesion & Peaceful Coexistence Between Refugees And Host Communities.” - Tumaini Letu

Innocent Magambi spoke on Active youth participation as a tool for social cohesion and peaceful coexistence.

Muriel Ilunga spoke on active youth leadership in social cohesion and peaceful coexistence.

Remy Gakwaya spoke on using entrepreneurship and innovation as a tool for youth economic empowerment and inclusion.

Toussaint Farini then spoke on Art and Culture as a tool for social cohesion and peaceful coexistence.

The conversation then evolved from there, with an interactive discussion wit the audience, tackling topics of challenges in entrepreneurship and life at large, and discussing ways in which young people can overcoming rejection among other things, to get to a place of collaboration and cohesion.

The event was closed by a delightful performance and dance from the Forus Dance Crew.
