This innovative project addresses the critical challenge of menstrual health management in Dzaleka refugee camp through a unique hybrid sanitary napkin design. The solution considers both the camp's water scarcity and waste management challenges while creating economic opportunities for refugee women.

### The Challenge

- Disposable pads often traded for food
- Limited waste disposal options

### Innovation Solution

#### Hybrid Pad Design
- Part reusable, part disposable construction
- Significantly reduced water requirements
- Minimized disposable waste
- Patent-pending technology
- User-centered design with three iterations

#### Economic Empowerment
- Production training for refugee teens
- Local manufacturing capability
- Sales and distribution opportunities
- Sustainable income generation
- Skills development

### Impact and Achievement

#### Production Milestones
- 1,000 pads produced and distributed
